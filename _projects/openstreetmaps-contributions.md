I have contributed to OpenStreetMaps since 2019, digitizing features with aerial imagery, using GPS tracks and waypoints, local knowledge and street-level imagery. 


The following map shows the geographic distribution of changes as a heatmap:

{% endraw %}

And the following map shows my overall contributions to openstreetmaps, in more detail, you can zoom to see the features I have added or modified in OSM and click to see complete properties of features in OSM:

{% endraw %} 

Both dynamic maps use Overpass API to query the features in OpenStreetMaps, then the XML data is converted to GeoJSON to be displayed in Leaflet.js
